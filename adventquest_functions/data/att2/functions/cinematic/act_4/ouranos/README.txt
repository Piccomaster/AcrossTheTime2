How is the structure organized in the dimension :

There is 3 towers and 3 paths to reach it. All mechanisms are organized by towers and paths.
All mechanisms of each tower are developed in order from the lowest to the highest altitude ("y" dimension).
All mechanisms of each tower's path are developed in chronological order of the main quest.
